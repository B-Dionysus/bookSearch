## Description
This is an app that lets users search for books via Google books. After they enter a search term and hit "submit," the first ten results appear. The user can click on a button to go to a page for more information about the book, or they can click on a button to save it to the database of favorites.

On the "Favorites" page, they can see all of the favorite books that people have saved. They can click a button to remove the book from the favorites list, and from the database entirely. My database, that is, not Google's.

There is also a "Make it sexy" button, which makes the book searches more sexy.

It's also fully responsive, so you can eat burgers to your heart's content, even on a mobile device! But I just used off-the-shelf bootstrap components for this, so that's not saying all that much.
